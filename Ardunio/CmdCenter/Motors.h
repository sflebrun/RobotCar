/**
 * Class that encapsulates the Motor Controller Shield for the Arduino.
 *
 * This class also hides the type of Motor Controller Shield being used.
 * In this case, it is the Mult-Motor Driver Shield (2-L293D).
 *
 * The motors used by the Robot Car are all DC Motors.
 *
 * See <a href="http://www.yourduino.com/sunshop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=292">
 * Motor Driver Shield L293D </a>
 *
 * @todo This class should be turned into a singleton class which would eliminate
 * the need for the CarMotor class, which turns Motor into a singleton.  The
 * reason this class needs to be a singleton is because each time an instance
 * of this class is created, the motors would be reset and stop.  If the car is
 * in motion, to would stop before changing speeds.
