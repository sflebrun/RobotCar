Source code by Steven F. LeBrun

This code is written to run on an Arduino UNO with an Multi-Motor Driver
Shield (2-L293D).  This shield can control four DC Motors and two servo
motors.  Attached to the shield are four DC Motors, one per wheel, one
servo motor [SG90 9 g Micro Servo] and one Ultrasonic Sensor [HC-SR04].

The Motor Controller shield uses most of the available pins on the
Arduino. Two pins necessary to trigger the ultrasonic sensor and the
echo for capturing the results.  Two of the analog pins on the Arduino
are used via the shield as digital pins.

The file sloeber.ino.cpp is generated by the Eclipse Plugin used to
develop Arduino code in the Eclipse IDE.
